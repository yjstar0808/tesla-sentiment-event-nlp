## 1. The question

> *Beyond merely predicting price, can we systematically decompose
> **how** news sentiment moves a stock — by horizon, by sign, by
> dispersion, and by market regime?*

Most prior LLM-era sentiment-and-returns work treats sentiment as a
single scalar feature and asks whether it improves price prediction.
That framing answers a thin question and obscures four substantive
structural ones:

1. **Time decay.** How quickly does the effect of a news shock decay
   across horizons? Is it exponential, linear, or essentially flat?
2. **Asymmetry.** Are negative-sentiment shocks bigger than
   positive-sentiment shocks of equal magnitude? Prospect theory
   predicts ≈2× loss-aversion (Kahneman & Tversky 1979); does it show
   up in equity-return panels?
3. **Dispersion.** Does cross-article *disagreement* (high `σ_S`)
   forecast future return *volatility* — independent of mean
   sentiment? Miller (1977) predicts yes.
4. **Regime moderation.** Are these effects stable, or do they
   strengthen / weaken in high-VIX / earnings-week / macro-stress regimes?

This project addresses all four jointly, using a single coherent
multi-window feature design.

## 3. What is reproduced in this repo today

Run `python scripts/run_vader_baseline.py` end-to-end (≈30 s on a CPU)
and you get:

| Step | Output | Numbers (real) |
|---|---|---|
| Corpus cleaning | `data/README.md` | 28,620 articles kept from 28,657 raw |
| Date span | `results/eda_summary.json` | 2021-01-01 → 2025-06-01 |
| Source coverage | `figures/eda_source_distribution.png` | 7 sources, BI/Bloomberg/TechCrunch/ABC/BBC/Wired/WSJ |
| VADER scoring | `results/vader_per_article.parquet` | mean 0.0021 · std 0.352 · 30.2% pos / 40.8% neu / 29.0% neg |
| Daily aggregation | `results/sentiment_daily.csv` | 1,106 trading days joined with TSLA returns |
| **Baseline correlation** | `results/baseline_correlation.json` | see Table 1 |

**Table 1 — Baseline single-feature correlations (TSLA, 2021-01 → 2025-06)**

| Pair | Pearson r | p | Spearman ρ | p |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Daily VADER vs same-day return | **0.084** | **0.005** | **0.082** | **0.006** |
| Daily VADER vs next-day return | 0.012 | 0.685 | 0.000 | 0.996 |

This is exactly the empirical gap the project is designed to close:
**news sentiment is significantly correlated with same-day returns
but a naive single-feature daily-mean has no next-day predictive
power**. The structural questions in §1 ask whether a
hypothesis-aligned multi-window feature set produces incremental
predictive R² above the controls-only baseline. That is the M1–M4
work in `docs/methodology.md` §5.

## 4. Status

| Component | State | Where to look |
|---|---|---|
| Corpus collection (28k articles) | ✅ Done | `data/README.md`, `results/eda_summary.json` |
| Deterministic pre-processing | ✅ Done | `src/preprocessing.py` |
| VADER scoring layer | ✅ Done | `src/sentiment.py::VaderScorer` |
| EDA & figures | ✅ Done | `scripts/run_eda.py` |
| Multi-window aggregator | ✅ Done (interface + impl) | `src/aggregation.py` |
| Feature / design-matrix builder | ✅ Done | `src/features.py` |

| FinBERT scoring layer | 🚧 In progress | `src/sentiment.py::score_corpus_finbert` |
| HAC-OLS for M1 / M2 hypothesis tests | 🚧 In progress | `src/model.py::fit_ols_with_hac` |
| Decay-curve fitting (H1b) | 🚧 In progress | `src/model.py::fit_decay_curve` |
| Asymmetry Wald test (H2a) | 🚧 In progress | `src/model.py::asymmetry_test` |

| Robustness battery (sub-period, source-drop, lag-grid) | 📋 Planned | proposal §6 |
| Manuscript draft | 📋 Planned | — |

Honest summary: **Stage 1 + baseline result are end-to-end reproducible
right now.** Stage 2b (FinBERT) and Stage 4 (hypothesis tests) are
architected and stubbed but not yet plugged into the driver script.

## 5. Reproducing the numbers

See **[docs/REPRODUCE.md](docs/REPRODUCE.md)** for a step-by-step.
TL;DR: three commands, ≈30 s on a laptop:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/run_eda.py
python scripts/run_vader_baseline.py
```

Every numeric value cited in this README is read directly from the
JSON / CSV produced by these scripts — nothing is hard-coded into the
documentation.

## 6. Methodology (one-page version)

  * **Target:** next-day log return `r_{t+1} = ln(P_{t+1} / P_t)`
  * **Sample:** TSLA, 2021-01-01 → 2025-06-01, ≈1,100 trading days
  * **Sentiment features** for each trading day `t`:
    `S_recent` (`t−7..t−1`), `S_medium` (`t−15..t−8`), `S_distant` (`t−30..t−16`),
    plus signed (`S+`, `S−`) and dispersion (`σ_S`) variants
  * **Controls:** market return (SPY), VIX, lagged return, volume change
  * **Estimator:** OLS with Newey-West HAC SE (lag = 5)
  * **Look-ahead bias guard:** day-`t` window is excluded from `S(t)`;
    target is strictly `r_{t+1}` measured at the next session's close

Full discussion in **[docs/methodology.md](docs/methodology.md)**.

## 7. What this preview is NOT

  * Not a productionised trading signal. The framework is descriptive
    research, not a strategy.
  * Not a benchmark against state-of-the-art deep models — the
    contribution is the **feature design**, paired with a deliberately
    simple linear estimator so the empirical claims attach to the
    design rather than to model capacity.
  * Not a causal identification. Every claim is a conditional
    correlation; the limitations section of the methodology doc
    spells this out.
